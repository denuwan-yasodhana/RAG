For these sophisticated \\nmeasurements, usually high performance \\ncameras with cooled detectors are used \\nunder controlled laboratory conditions.\\nHowever, the use of thermal imaging cameras \\nfor solar panel evaluation is not restricted \\nto the field of research. Uncooled thermal \\nimaging cameras are currently being used \\nmore and more for solar panel quality controls \\nbefore installation and regular predictive \\nmaintenance checkups after the panel has \\nbeen installed. Because these affordable \\ncameras are handheld and lightweight, they \\nallow a very flexible use in the field.\\nWith a thermal imaging camera, potential \\nproblem areas can be detected and repaired \\nbefore actual problems or failures occur. But \\nnot every thermal imaging camera is suited \\nfor solar cell inspection, and there are some \\nrules and guidelines that need to be followed \\nin order to perform efficient inspections and \\nto ensure that you draw correct conclusions. \\nThe examples in this article are based on \\nphotovoltaic modules with crystalline solar \\ncells; however, the rules and  guidelines \\nare also applicable to the thermographic \\ninspection of thin-film modules, as the basic \\nconcepts of thermography are the same.\\nProcedures for inspecting solar panels \\nwith thermal imaging cameras\\nDuring the development and production \\nprocess, solar cells are triggered either \\nelectrically or by the use of flash lamps. \\nThis ensures that there is sufficient thermal \\ncontrast \\nfor \\naccurate \\nthermographic \\nmeasurements.

The solar irradiance \\ndescribes the instantaneous power incident \\non a surface in units of kW/m2, which can \\nbe measured with either a pyranometer (for \\nglobal solar irradiance) or a pyrheliometer \\n(for direct solar irradiance). It strongly \\ndepends on location and local weather. \\nLow outside temperatures may also increase \\nthermal contrast.\\nQuality assurance is of fundamental importance for solar panels. The failure-free operation of \\nthe panels is a prerequisite for efficient power generation, long life, and a high return on the \\ninvestment. To ensure this failure free operation a fast, simple and reliable method to evaluate a \\nsolar panel's performance is required, both during the production process and after the panel has \\nbeen installed. \\nThe use of thermal imaging cameras for solar panel evaluation offers several advantages. \\nAnomalies can clearly be seen on a crisp thermal image and - unlike most other methods - thermal \\ncameras can be used to scan installed solar panels during normal operation.

However, glass is not \\ntransparent in this region. When solar cells \\nare inspected from the front, a thermal \\nimaging camera sees the heat distribution \\non the glass surface but only indirectly the \\nheat distribution in the underlying cells. \\nTherefore, the temperature differences that \\ncan be measured and seen on the solar \\npanel’s glass surface are small. In order for \\nthese differences to be visible, the thermal \\nimaging camera used for these inspections \\nneeds a thermal sensitivity ≤0.08K. To clearly \\nvisualize small temperature differences in the \\nthermal image, the camera should also allow \\nmanual adjustment of the level and span. \\nPhotovoltaic modules are generally mounted \\non highly reflective aluminum framework, \\nwhich shows up as a cold area on the thermal \\nimage, because it reflects the thermal radiation \\nemitted by the sky. In practice that means that \\nthe thermal imaging camera will record the \\nframework temperature as being well below \\n0°C. Because the thermal imaging camera\\'s \\nhistogram equalization automatically adapts \\nto the maximum and minimum measured \\ntemperatures, many small thermal anomalies \\nwill not immediately be visible. To achieve \\na high contrast thermal image continuous \\nmanual correction of the level and span would \\nbe needed.\\nThe \\nso-called \\nDDE \\n(Digital \\nDetail \\nEnhancement) functionality provides the \\nsolution. DDE automatically optimizes image \\ncontrast in high dynamic range scenes, \\nand the thermal image no longer needs to \\nbe adjusted manually. A thermal imaging \\ncamera that has DDE is therefore well suited \\nfor fast and accurate solar panel inspections.\\nUseful features \\nAnother useful feature for a thermal imaging \\ncamera is the tagging of thermal images \\nwith GPS data. This helps to localize faulty \\nmodules easily in large areas, e.g., in solar \\nfarms, and also to relate the thermal images \\nto the equipment, e.g., in reports.\\nThe thermal imaging camera should have a \\nbuilt-in digital camera so that the associated \\nvisual image (digital photo) can be saved \\nwith the related thermal image. A so-called \\nfusion mode, allowing the thermal and \\nvisual images to be superimposed, is also \\nuseful. Voice and text comments that can be \\nsaved in the camera along with the thermal \\nimage are beneficial for reporting.\\nPositioning the camera: take into \\naccount reflections and emissivity\\nEven though glass has an emissivity of \\n0.85–0.90 in the 8–14 μm waveband, \\nthermal measurements on glass surfaces \\nare not easy to do. Glass reflections are \\nspecular, which means that surrounding \\nobjects with different temperatures can be \\nseen clearly in the thermal image. In the \\nworst case, this results in misinterpretations \\n(false \"hotspots\") and measurement errors.\\nIn order to avoid reflection of the thermal \\nimaging camera and the operator in \\nthe glass, it should not be positioned \\nperpendicularly to the module being \\ninspected. However, emissivity is at its \\nhighest when the camera is perpendicular, \\nand decreases with an increasing angle. \\nA viewing angle of 5–60° is a good \\ncompromise (where 0° is perpendicular).\\nThermal image without DDE (left) and with DDE (right).\\nAngle dependence of the emissivity of glass\\nViewing angle recommended (green) and to be \\navoided (red) during thermographic inspections.\\nEmissivity\\nReflectance\\nAngle of incidence (DEG)\\n1\\n0.8\\n0.6\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n15\\n30\\n45\\n60\\n75\\n90\\n0'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)', 'creationdate': '2011-03-08T19:02:03+08:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAG/rag_pipline_project_1/data/pdf/Thermal-imaging-cameras-testing-solar-panels.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAG/rag_pipline_project_1/data/pdf/Thermal-imaging-cameras-testing-solar-panels.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2011-03-08T19:02:05+08:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20110308190205+08'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20110308190203+08'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='Long distance observations \\nIt is not always easy to achieve a suitable \\nviewing angle during the measurement \\nset-up.

In \\nthese cases, the longer distance from the \\ntarget can be advantageous, since a larger \\narea can be seen in one pass. To ensure \\nthe quality of the thermal image, a thermal \\nimaging camera with an image resolution \\nof at least 320 × 240 pixels, preferably 640 × \\n480 pixels, should be used for these longer \\ndistances.\\nThe \\ncamera \\nshould \\nalso \\nhave \\nan \\ninterchangeable lens, so the operator can \\nswitch to a telephoto lens for long distance \\nobservations, such as from a helicopter.
