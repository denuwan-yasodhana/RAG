However, glass is not \\ntransparent in this region. When solar cells \\nare inspected from the front, a thermal \\nimaging camera sees the heat distribution \\non the glass surface but only indirectly the \\nheat distribution in the underlying cells. \\nTherefore, the temperature differences that \\ncan be measured and seen on the solar \\npanel’s glass surface are small. In order for \\nthese differences to be visible, the thermal \\nimaging camera used for these inspections \\nneeds a thermal sensitivity ≤0.08K. To clearly \\nvisualize small temperature differences in the \\nthermal image, the camera should also allow \\nmanual adjustment of the level and span. \\nPhotovoltaic modules are generally mounted \\non highly reflective aluminum framework, \\nwhich shows up as a cold area on the thermal \\nimage, because it reflects the thermal radiation \\nemitted by the sky. In practice that means that \\nthe thermal imaging camera will record the \\nframework temperature as being well below \\n0°C. Because the thermal imaging camera\\'s \\nhistogram equalization automatically adapts \\nto the maximum and minimum measured \\ntemperatures, many small thermal anomalies \\nwill not immediately be visible. To achieve \\na high contrast thermal image continuous \\nmanual correction of the level and span would \\nbe needed.\\nThe so-called DDE (Digital Detail \\nEnhancement) functionality provides the \\nsolution. DDE automatically optimizes image \\ncontrast in high dynamic range scenes, \\nand the thermal image no longer needs to \\nbe adjusted manually. A thermal imaging \\ncamera that has DDE is therefore well suited \\nfor fast and accurate solar panel inspections.\\nUseful features \\nAnother useful feature for a thermal imaging \\ncamera is the tagging of thermal images \\nwith GPS data. This helps to localize faulty \\nmodules easily in large areas, e.g., in solar \\nfarms, and also to relate the thermal images \\nto the equipment, e.g., in reports.\\nThe thermal imaging camera should have a \\nbuilt-in digital camera so that the associated \\nvisual image (digital photo) can be saved \\nwith the related thermal image. A so-called \\nfusion mode, allowing the thermal and \\nvisual images to be superimposed, is also \\nuseful. Voice and text comments that can be \\nsaved in the camera along with the thermal \\nimage are beneficial for reporting.\\nPositioning the camera: take into \\naccount reflections and emissivity\\nEven though glass has an emissivity of \\n0.85–0.90 in the 8–14 μm waveband, \\nthermal measurements on glass surfaces \\nare not easy to do. Glass reflections are \\nspecular, which means that surrounding \\nobjects with different temperatures can be \\nseen clearly in the thermal image. In the \\nworst case, this results in misinterpretations \\n(false \"hotspots\") and measurement errors.\\nIn order to avoid reflection of the thermal \\nimaging camera and the operator in \\nthe glass, it should not be positioned \\nperpendicularly to the module being \\ninspected. However, emissivity is at its \\nhighest when the camera is perpendicular, \\nand decreases with an increasing angle. \\nA viewing angle of 5–60° is a good \\ncompromise (where 0° is perpendicular).\\nThermal image without DDE (left) and with DDE (right).\\nAngle dependence of the emissivity of glass\\nViewing angle recommended (green) and to be \\navoided (red) during thermographic inspections.\\nEmissivity\\nReflectance\\nAnglE of incidEncE  (dEg)\\n1\\n0.8\\n0.6\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n15 30 45 60 75 900'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)', 'creationdate': '2011-03-08T19:02:03+08:00', 'moddate': '2011-03-08T19:02:05+08:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAG/rag_pipline_project_1/data/pdf/Thermal-imaging-cameras-testing-solar-panels.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3', 'source_file': 'Thermal-imaging-cameras-testing-solar-panels.pdf', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='Long distance observations \\nIt is not always easy to achieve a suitable \\nviewing angle during the measurement \\nset-up. Using a tripod can provide a \\nsolution in most cases. In more difficult \\nconditions it might be necessary to use \\nmobile working platforms or even to fly \\nover the solar cells with a helicopter. In \\nthese cases, the longer distance from the \\ntarget can be advantageous, since a larger \\narea can be seen in one pass. To ensure \\nthe quality of the thermal image, a thermal \\nimaging camera with an image resolution \\nof at least 320 × 240 pixels, preferably 640 × \\n480 pixels, should be used for these longer \\ndistances.\\nThe camera should also have an \\ninterchangeable lens, so the operator can \\nswitch to a telephoto lens for long distance \\nobservations, such as from a helicopter. It is \\nadvisable, however, to only use telephoto \\nlenses with thermal imaging cameras \\nthat have a high image resolution. Low \\nresolution thermal imaging cameras will be \\nunable to pick up the small thermal details \\nthat indicate solar panel faults in long \\ndistance measurements using a telephoto \\nlens.\\nLooking at it from a different perspective \\nIn most cases installed photovoltaic \\nmodules can also be inspected with a \\nthermal imaging camera from the rear of a \\nmodule.

Calm conditions are \\ndesirable, since any airflow on the surface \\nof the solar module will cause convective \\ncooling and thus will reduce the thermal \\ngradient. The cooler the air temperature, \\nthe higher the potential thermal contrast. \\nPerforming thermographic inspections in \\nthe early morning is an option.\\nAnother way to enhance thermal contrast \\nis to disconnect the cells from a load, to \\nprevent the flow of current, which allows \\nheating to occur through solar irradiance \\nalone. A load is then connected, and the cells \\nare observed in the heating phase.\\nUnder normal circumstances, however, the \\nsystem should be inspected under standard \\noperating conditions, namely under load. \\nDepending on the type of cell and the kind \\nof fault or failure, measurements under \\nno-load or short-circuit conditions can \\nprovide additional information.\\nMeasurement errors\\nMeasurement errors arise primarily due to \\npoor camera positioning and suboptimal \\nambient and measurement conditions. \\nTypical measurement errors are caused by:\\n•\\ttoo\\tshallow\\tviewing\\tangle\\n•\\t\\t\\tchange\\tin\\tsolar\\tirradiance\\tover\\ttime\\t(due\\t\\nto changes in sky cover, for example)\\n•\\t\\t\\treflections\\t(e.g.,\\tsun,\\tclouds,\\tsurrounding\\t\\nbuil dings of greater height, measurement \\nset-ups)\\n•\\t\\t\\tpartial\\tshadowing\\t(e.g.,\\tdue\\tto\\tsurrounding\\t\\nbuildings or other structures).\\nWhat can you see in the thermal image\\nIf parts of the solar panel are hotter than \\nothers, the warm areas will show up clearly \\nin the thermal image.
